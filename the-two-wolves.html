                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">I personally would like to divide this world into two parts, one of side stand the people who are Hindu and on the other who are not.</p>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4"><em>Who are Hindus?</em>   People who <strong>believe</strong> in Hinduism ideology are Hindus is a simple answer to say. Please see that I used word believe instead of practice. Just practice won't make you Hindu. Non-Hindus also include families that got converted to Muslim due to circumstances in Mughal reign and presently they may even don't know of the reality.</p>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4"><em>Why I choose this criteria to divide the world?</em>  Hinduism has given us answers to lot of questions we can barely think to answer, e.g. how the world started and how it would end. Some people make fun of those answers as they look it superficially. I would like to keep such people on the other side. But in reality, our present day science is dying hard to come equivalent to what has already been answered. And that is why I feel myself lucky to be Hindu.</p>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">If we look upon any past or present day world event, you will see that some of the people agree with a side while others like the opposite. We humans are made like this only, i.e. we choose a side which may be beneficial for us. But if we observe the event closely, we will find that it is a conflict of ideologies instead of nation or community. The ideologies that have been rooted deep into us based on birth-place, workplace, people around us. What I managed to find is that Hinduism ideology in most of the conflict will be fighting for righteousness while the other trying to oppress it is for the existence. We will have a talk on this in details and example in upcoming posts.</p>
